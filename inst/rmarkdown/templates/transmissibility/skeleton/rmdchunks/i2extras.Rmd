## _i2extras_

```{r lockfile-rt, include = FALSE, message = FALSE}
renv::use("i2extras@0.2.1")
```

```{r rt-load-pkg}
library(i2extras)
```

### Explanations

The package *i2extras* is used to estimate daily growth rates '_r_', using Poisson
GLMs fitted to epidemic curves. These estimates can be biased by reporting
delays. Here, we exclude the last `r params$incomplete_days` days as incomplete,
and retain a total of `r params$r_estim_window` days to estimate the growth
rate.

Growth rates can be interpreted as the percent change in daily
incidence. Positive numbers indicate growth, while negative numbers indicate
decline, of the epidemic. For instance:

* $r = 0.02$ means that the number of new cases increases on average by 2% each day
* $r = -0.13$ means that the number of new cases decreases on average by 13% each day

Growth rates can also be converted to _doubling times_ (when $r > 0$) or
_halving times_ (when $r < 0$), defined as the time it takes for the daily
incidence to double (respectively, halve).

For more information on growth rates, see this [blog post by Pr Julia Gog](https://plus.maths.org/content/epidemic-growth-rate).

### Results

This section contains:

* graphs showing the models fitted to epidemic curves, with their associated 95% confidence
intervals (CI)

* graphs showing the estimates of the growth rates ($r$) with their 95% CI

* a table summarizing estimates of $r$ and the associated period (doubling or
  halving time); all results show point estimates and their 95% CI

#### Estimating $R$ from the growth rates

Wallinga and Lipsitch have introduced methods for converting daily growth rates
($r$) into reproduction numbers ($R$) [@Wallinga2007-hw], when information on
the serial interval distribution is available. $R$ represents the average number
of secondary cases generated by an infected patient. Like the daily growth rate,
$R$ can be used to gauge the dynamics of an epidemic:

* $R > 1$: the epidemic will grow exponentially
* $R < 1$: the epidemic will decline exponentially

Note that $R$ only speaks to the number of new cases created, not how fast these
are generated, so on its own it is not sufficient to indicate how fast the
epidemic is growing. For a comparison of $r$ and $R$, we recommend reading this
[blog post by Pr Julia Gog](https://plus.maths.org/content/epidemic-growth-rate).

Here, we use the procedure implemented in `epitrix` to derive samples of $R$
values compatible with the values of $r$ estimated in the previous section, and
with the provided serial interval.

This section contains:

* a graph showing the distribution of $R$ values estimated from the daily growth
  rates; each violin shows the density of values based on a sample of 500 from
  the Student distribution associated with the estimate of $r$; the line range
  represents the 95% confidence interval (horizontal segment) and the median
  (dot)
  
* a table summarizing the estimated distributions of $R$ values 

```{r }
res_R_wl <- last_trends %>%
  mutate(R = map(model, epitrix::lm2R0_sample, w = si, 500)) %>%
  dplyr::select({{ group_var }}, R) %>%
  unnest(R)

res_R_wl_smry <- res_R_wl %>%
  group_by(.data[[group_var]]) %>%
  summarise(
    mean   = mean(R),
    median = median(R),
    lower  = quantile(R, 0.025),
    upper  = quantile(R, 0.975)
  )

res_R_wl %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = .data[[group_var]]), fill = custom_grey) +
  geom_violin(aes(x = R), fill = pale_green, color = green_grey) +
  geom_pointrange(
    data = res_R_wl_smry,
    aes(x = median, xmin = lower, xmax = upper),
    color = dark_green
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, color = dark_pink) +
  labs(
    title = "Reproduction numbers estimated from growth rates",
    subtitle = sprintf(
      "based on data from %s - %s",
      format(min(get_dates(last_counts)), "%d %B %Y"),
      format(max(get_dates(last_counts)), "%d %B %Y")
    ),
    y = "",
    x = "Reproduction number"
  )

res_R_wl_smry %>%
  mutate(
    mean = round(mean, 2),
    median = round(median, 2),
    `95% ci` = sprintf(
      "[%1.2f ; %1.2f]",
      lower,
      upper
    )
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(lower, upper)) %>%
  rename(
    "mean $R$" = mean,
    "median $R$" = median
  ) %>%
  set_names(toupper) %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper("striped", font_size = 18, full_width = FALSE)
