  abstract = "Recent years have seen the development of numerous methodologies
              for reconstructing transmission trees in infectious disease
              outbreaks from densely sampled whole genome sequence data.
              However, a fundamental and as of yet poorly addressed limitation
              of such approaches is the requirement for genetic diversity to
              arise on epidemiological timescales. Specifically, the position
              of infected individuals in a transmission tree can only be
              resolved by genetic data if mutations have accumulated between
              the sampled pathogen genomes. To quantify and compare the useful
              genetic diversity expected from genetic data in different
              pathogen outbreaks, we introduce here the concept of
              'transmission divergence', defined as the number of mutations
              separating whole genome sequences sampled from transmission
              pairs. Using parameter values obtained by literature review, we
              simulate outbreak scenarios alongside sequence evolution using
              two models described in the literature to describe transmission
              divergence of ten major outbreak-causing pathogens. We find that
              while mean values vary significantly between the pathogens
              considered, their transmission divergence is generally very low,
              with many outbreaks characterised by large numbers of genetically
              identical transmission pairs. We describe the impact of
              transmission divergence on our ability to reconstruct outbreaks
              using two outbreak reconstruction tools, the R packages
              outbreaker and phybreak, and demonstrate that, in agreement with
              previous observations, genetic sequence data of rapidly evolving
              pathogens such as RNA viruses can provide valuable information on
              individual transmission events. Conversely, sequence data of
              pathogens with lower mean transmission divergence, including
              Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei and Clostridium
              difficile, provide little to no information about individual
              transmission events. Our results highlight the informational
              limitations of genetic sequence data in certain outbreak
              scenarios, and demonstrate the need to expand the toolkit of
              outbreak reconstruction tools to integrate other types of
              epidemiological data.",

              statistically rigorous frameworks to infer outbreak transmission
              trees (``who infected whom'') from epidemiological and genetic
              data. Making use of pathogen genome sequences in such analyses
              remains a challenge, however, with a variety of heuristic
              approaches having been explored to date. We introduce a
              statistical method exploiting both pathogen sequences and
              collection dates to unravel the dynamics of densely sampled
              outbreaks. Our approach identifies likely transmission events and
              infers dates of infections, unobserved cases and separate
              introductions of the disease. It also proves useful for inferring
              numbers of secondary infections and identifying heterogeneous
              infectivity and super-spreaders. After testing our approach using
              simulations, we illustrate the method with the analysis of the
              beginning of the 2003 Singaporean outbreak of Severe Acute
              Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), providing new insights into the
              early stage of this epidemic. Our approach is the first tool for
              disease outbreak reconstruction from genetic data widely

              applicable to various densely sampled epidemics, and improves
              previous approaches by detecting unobserved and imported cases,
              as well as allowing multiple introductions of the pathogen.
              Because of its generality, we believe this method will become a
              tool of choice for the analysis of densely sampled disease

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Reconstructing individual transmission events in an
              infectious disease outbreak can provide valuable information and
              help inform infection control policy. Recent years have seen
              considerable progress in the development of methodologies for
              reconstructing transmission chains using both epidemiological and
              genetic data. However, only a few of these methods have been
              implemented in software packages, and with little consideration
              for customisability and interoperability. Users are therefore
              limited to a small number of alternatives, incompatible tools
              with fixed functionality, or forced to develop their own
              algorithms at considerable personal effort. RESULTS: Here we
              present outbreaker2, a flexible framework for outbreak
              reconstruction. This R package re-implements and extends the
              original model introduced with outbreaker, but most importantly
              also provides a modular platform allowing users to specify custom
              models within an optimised inferential framework. As a proof of
              concept, we implement the within-host evolutionary model
              introduced with TransPhylo, which is very distinct from the
              original genetic model in outbreaker, and demonstrate how even
              complex model results can be successfully included with minimal
              effort. CONCLUSIONS: outbreaker2 provides a valuable starting
              point for future outbreak reconstruction tools, and represents a
              unifying platform that promotes customisability and
              interoperability. Implemented in the R software, outbreaker2

              computational tools for inferring 'who infected whom' in an
              infectious disease outbreak from densely sampled case data, with
              most recent studies focusing on the analysis of whole genome
              sequence data. However, genomic data can be poorly informative of
              transmission events if mutations accumulate too slowly to resolve
              individual transmission pairs or if there exist multiple
              pathogens lineages within-host, and there has been little focus
              on incorporating other types of outbreak data. We present here a
              methodology that uses contact data for the inference of
              transmission trees in a statistically rigorous manner, alongside
              genomic data and temporal data. Contact data is frequently
              collected in outbreaks of pathogens spread by close contact,
              including Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome
              coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and
              routinely used to reconstruct transmission chains. As an
              improvement over previous, ad-hoc approaches, we developed a
              probabilistic model that relates a set of contact data to an
              underlying transmission tree and integrated this in the
              outbreaker2 inference framework. By analyzing simulated outbreaks
              under various contact tracing scenarios, we demonstrate that
              contact data significantly improves our ability to reconstruct
              transmission trees, even under realistic limitations on the
              coverage of the contact tracing effort and the amount of
              non-infectious mixing between cases. Indeed, contact data is
              equally or more informative than fully sampled whole genome
              sequence data in certain scenarios. We then use our method to
              analyze the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore
              and describe the range of transmission scenarios consistent with
              contact data and genetic sequence in a probabilistic manner for
              the first time. This simple yet flexible model can easily be
              incorporated into existing tools for outbreak reconstruction and
              should permit a better integration of genomic and epidemiological

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: On March 23, 2014, the World Health Organization
              (WHO) was notified of an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in
              Guinea. On August 8, the WHO declared the epidemic to be a
              ``public health emergency of international concern.'' METHODS: By
              September 14, 2014, a total of 4507 probable and confirmed cases,
              including 2296 deaths from EVD (Zaire species) had been reported
              from five countries in West Africa--Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria,
              Senegal, and Sierra Leone. We analyzed a detailed subset of data
              on 3343 confirmed and 667 probable Ebola cases collected in
              Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone as of September 14.
              RESULTS: The majority of patients are 15 to 44 years of age
              (49.9\% male), and we estimate that the case fatality rate is
              70.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 69 to 73) among persons
              with known clinical outcome of infection. The course of
              infection, including signs and symptoms, incubation period (11.4
              days), and serial interval (15.3 days), is similar to that
              reported in previous outbreaks of EVD. On the basis of the
              initial periods of exponential growth, the estimated basic
              reproduction numbers (R0 ) are 1.71 (95\% CI, 1.44 to 2.01) for
              Guinea, 1.83 (95\% CI, 1.72 to 1.94) for Liberia, and 2.02 (95\%
              CI, 1.79 to 2.26) for Sierra Leone. The estimated current
              reproduction numbers (R) are 1.81 (95\% CI, 1.60 to 2.03) for
              Guinea, 1.51 (95\% CI, 1.41 to 1.60) for Liberia, and 1.38 (95\%
              CI, 1.27 to 1.51) for Sierra Leone; the corresponding doubling
              times are 15.7 days (95\% CI, 12.9 to 20.3) for Guinea, 23.6 days
              (95\% CI, 20.2 to 28.2) for Liberia, and 30.2 days (95\% CI, 23.6
              to 42.3) for Sierra Leone. Assuming no change in the control
              measures for this epidemic, by November 2, 2014, the cumulative
              reported numbers of confirmed and probable cases are predicted to
              be 5740 in Guinea, 9890 in Liberia, and 5000 in Sierra Leone,
              exceeding 20,000 in total. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that
              without drastic improvements in control measures, the numbers of
              cases of and deaths from EVD are expected to continue increasing
              from hundreds to thousands per week in the coming months.",

              individual. Several methods have been proposed to estimate R over

              reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases
              caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be
              estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at
              successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the
              serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a
              transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction
              number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval
              distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by
              local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of

              reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the
              value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly
              from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such
              inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that
              relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is
              unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection.
              Here, we show that these different equations differ only with
              respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval
